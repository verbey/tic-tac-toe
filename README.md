# Tic-Tac-Toe
## Overview
This project lets the user play the classic game of tic tac toe against a bot or a real player. It was made as a part of [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe) course.

## Code
The code is pushed to both [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/Verbiturum/tic-tac-toe) and [Github](https://github.com/verbey/tic-tac-toe).

## Live demo
You can see the live version [here](https://verbiturum.codeberg.page/tic-tac-toe/). 

## Features
- Uses a neat Discord-inspired color theme.
- The bot AI was implemented with the minimax algorithm to pick the most optimal option possible on each turn. It is not possible to win against it, in the best case scenario you will only achieve a tie.
- You can start a game of two bots and see how the minimax algorithm will "play" against itself.
